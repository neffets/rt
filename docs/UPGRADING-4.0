Common Issues

RT now defaults to a database name of rt4 and an installation root of /opt/rt4.

If you are upgrading, you will likely want to specify that your database
is still named rt3 (or import a backup of your database as rt4 so that
you can feel more confident making the upgrade).

You really shouldn't install RT4 into your RT3 source tree (/opt/rt3)
and instead should be using make install to set up a clean environment.
This will allow you to evaluate your local modifications and configuration
changes as you migrate to 4.0.

If you choose to force RT to install into /opt/rt3, or another existing RT 3.x
install location, you will encounter issues because we removed the _Overlay
files (such as Ticket_Overlay.pm) and relocated other files.  You will
need to manually remove these files after the upgrade or RT will fail.
After making a complete backup of your /opt/rt3 install, you might use a
command like the following to remove the _Overlay files:

    find /opt/rt3/lib/ -type f -name '*_Overlay*' -delete

RT has also changed how web deployment works; you will need to review
docs/web_deployment.pod for current instructions.  The old
`fastcgi_server`, `webmux.pl`, and `mason_handler.*` files will not
work with RT 4.0, and should be removed to reduce confusion.

*******
RT_SiteConfig.pm

You will need to carefully review your local settings when moving from
3.8 to 4.0.

If you were adding your own custom statuses in earlier versions of RT,
using ActiveStatus or InactiveStatus you will need to port these to use
the new Lifecycles functionality.  You can read more about it in
RT_Config.pm.  In most cases, you can do this by extending the default
active and inactive lists.

*******
Upgrading sessions on MySQL

In 4.0.0rc2, RT began shipping an updated schema for the sesions table
that specificies a character set as well as making the table InnoDB.  As
part of the upgrade process, your sessions table will be dropped and
recreated with the new schema.

*******
UPGRADING FROM RT 3.8.x and RTFM 2.1 or greater

RT4 now includes an Articles functionality, merged from RTFM.
You should not install and enable the RT::FM plugin separately on RT 4.
If you have existing data in RTFM, you can use the etc/upgrade/upgrade-articles
script to upgrade that data.

When running normal upgrade scripts, RT will warn if it finds existing
RTFM tables that contain data and point you to the upgrade-articles script.

This script should be run from your RT tarball.  It will immediately
begin populating your new RT4 tables with data from RTFM.  If you have
browsed in the RT4 UI and created new classes and articles, this script
will fail spectacularly.  Do *not* run this except on a fresh upgrade of
RT.

You can run this as

  etc/upgrade/upgrade-articles

It will ouput a lot of data about what it is changing.  You should
review this for errors.

If you are running RTFM 2.0 with a release of RT, there isn't currently an upgrade
script that can port RTFM's internal CustomField and Transaction data to RT4.

You must also remove RT::FM from your @Plugins line in RT_SiteConfig.pm.

*******
The deprecated classes RT::Action::Generic, RT::Condition::Generic and RT::Search::Generic
have been removed, but you shouldn't have been using them anyway. You should have been using
RT::Action, RT::Condition and RT::Search, respectively.

* The "Rights Delegation" and "Personal Groups" features have been removed.

* Replace the following code in templates:

    [{$Ticket->QueueObj->SubjectTag || $rtname} #{$Ticket->id}]

with

    { $Ticket->SubjectTag }

* Unique names are now enforced for user defined groups.  New groups cannot be
  created with a duplicate name and existing groups cannot be renamed to an
  in-use name.  The admin interface will warn about existing groups with
  duplicate names.  Although the groups will still function, some parts of the
  interface (rights management, subgroup membership) may not work as expected
  with duplicate names.  Running

    /opt/rt4/sbin/rt-validator --check

  will report duplicate group names, and running it with --resolve will fix
  duplicates by appending the group id to the name.

  Nota Bene: As a result of differing indexes in the schema files, Postgres and
  SQLite RT databases have enforced group name uniqueness for many years at the
  database level.

UPGRADING FROM 4.0.5 and earlier - Changes:

The fix for an attribute truncation bug on MySQL requires a small ALTER TABLE.
Be sure you run `make upgrade-database` to apply this change automatically.
The bug primarily manifested when uploading large logos in the theme editor on
MySQL.  Refer to etc/upgrade/4.0.6/schema.mysql for the actual ALTER TABLE that
will be run.

*******
The web-based query builder now uses Queue limits to restrict the set of
displayed statuses and owners.  As part of this change, the %cfqueues
parameter was renamed to %Queues; if you have local modifications to any
of the following Mason templates, this feature will not function
correctly:

    share/html/Elements/SelectOwner
    share/html/Elements/SelectStatus
    share/html/Prefs/Search.html
    share/html/Search/Build.html
    share/html/Search/Elements/BuildFormatString
    share/html/Search/Elements/PickCFs
    share/html/Search/Elements/PickCriteria
